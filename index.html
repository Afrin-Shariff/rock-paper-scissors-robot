        <h3><strong>EASY:</strong></h3>
        <body>In this easy mode, it is very simple. It is just an ordinary game of rock paper scissors. The computer will get to choose randomly and it will try to beat you. First to 5 wins. If you beat the computer in 1 round then you get 1 point. If the computer beats you in one round then the compouter gets 1 point. If you tie, then no one gets anything. GOOD LUCK! </body>
